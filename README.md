Angular-colorlist
=================

A short app listing basic CSS colors name, hex and RGB codes.

That application does nothing but demonstrate how quick and easy it is to setup an app with AngularJS.

We create an app, list colors datas and display the thing with the ng-repeater displaying all our colors entries
